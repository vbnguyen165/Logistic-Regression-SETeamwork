DATA-231: Applied Statistical Methods

**How Gender, Team Size, and Commit History can Predict the
Effectiveness of Software Engineering Teamwork in an Educational
Setting**

I. Introduction
===============

Teamwork has been consistently recognized as an essential skill for
software engineering practices. Several studies have been carried out to
investigate the important factors associated with effective teamwork in
software engineering. According to Verner et al. (2014), low motivation
is found to be associated with the failure of software development team
in a professional setting. Motivational factors such as whether the
working environment is of great quality and whether the software
engineer has a pleasant experience are highly related to the team's
productivity (Verner et al., 2014). In an educational setting, the
Software Engineering Teamwork Assessment and Prediction (SETAP) project,
led by San Francisco State University, predicted teamwork performance
based on students' activities on their final group project. SETAP
focuses mainly on predicting whether the groups of students meet certain
expectation on effective software engineering teamwork using a random
forest classifier (Petkovic et al., 2016). According to Petkovic et al.
(2016), the top predictors of teamwork success or failure are said to be
intuitive, including the number of issues that needs an instructor's
intervention and the average number of unique versions of code that were
saved.

Using the same data from the SETAP project, this research paper, rather
than creating a model with a powerful predicting ability, focuses on
identifying the relevant factors associated with effective teamwork in
software engineering classes. Teamwork performance will be assessed
based on two criteria: process (how well the team applied best software
engineering practices) and product (the quality of the finished product
the team produced). Teamwork process and product are separately
assessed, each in two phases -- the design phase and the implementation
phase. Through statistical analysis and models, this paper aims to
address the relationship between teamwork performance and the following
factors: team size (number of team members), gender, and commit history
(unique saved versions of the code).

II. Methods
===========

The data used in this research is provided by the San Francisco State
University in dedication to the SETAP project. As students in software
engineering classesÂ at San Francisco State University worked on their
final group project, team activity measures such as number of people in
a team, total number of meeting hours, percentage of each gender in a
team, etc. were collected. The team activity measures were aggregated
through three main sources: the collection of the individual activity
measures of each team member from weekly timecards, instructor
observations, and software engineering tool usage logs. The collection
of data was conducted for several consecutive semesters and achieved a
sample of 74 observations (teams of students). This data, then, is not
random but rather a census record that reflects the purpose of an
observational study.

Like SETAP, this research paper is concerned with two response
variables: the software engineering (SE) process grade and the software
engineering (SE) product grade. Both of these variables have 2 levels: A
and F, which indicate whether the team process/product is at expectation
level or below expectation level, respectively. Out of 50 variables
provided by the original data set, this research considered 8
explanatory variables: number of team members, percentage of female
members in a team, gender of team leader, average meeting hours per
member, average time spent on coding deliverables per member, average
time spent on non-coding deliverables per member, average number of
commits per member, and average number of unique messages associated
with the commits. A commit is defined as a unique version of the code
that is saved to the repository. Each commit has a message that briefly
describes the changes have been made to the code.

With the same response variables that were collected at the end of the
software engineering project, explanatory variables (except for
demographic information that stays constant throughout the project such
as number of team members, percentage of female members, gender of team
leader) were collected separately in two phases -- the design phase and
the implementation phase. The design phase refers to when the team
identified high level requirements, followed by more detailed
requirements, and finally working on their first prototype. The
implementation phase refers to the completion of their first prototype,
followed by beta release and the final product.

Through analysis and modeling, three explanatory variables were recoded.
First, the percentage of female was converted from a numerical variable
to a binary one to indicates whether the team has at least one female
team member. Second, the number of team members was recoded to whether a
team has 3 or more than 3 members. Third, the average number of commits
per team was converted into whether the team had made at least 20
commits on average. In summarizing the variables individually,
proportions, and conditional proportions were calculated for categorical
variables while means, medians, and standard deviation were calculated
for quantitative variables. To investigate the relationship between
categorical explanatory variables, two-sample proportion tests are
utilized. Given the nature of the data and research questions, four
logistic regression models were fitted for each of the two assessments
(SE product grade and SE process grade) in each of the two phases
(design and implementation). In fine-tuning the models, two methods were
at play: leave-one-out cross validation and step-wise selection based on
AIC. AIC is an estimator of out-of-sample prediction error for logistic
regression that is similar to adjusted R-squared in multiple linear
regression. In leave-one-out cross validation, to calculate the accuracy
rate of the model and at the same time avoids overfitting, the data set
is split into a training set and a testing set n times, where the
training set has n -- 1 observation, and the testing set has the
remaining observation.

III. Results
============

In the assessment of the software engineering teamwork process, 66.2% of
the 74 teams receive grade A (at or above expectation) and 33.8% receive
grade F (below expectation). In assessing teamwork based on the software
product, 56.8% of the teams receive grade A (at or above expectation)
and 43.2% receive grade F (below expectation). Table 1 and 2 showcase
the demographic of the 74 teams from the sample based on the important
variables.

###  a. Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis has found that the significant factors related to SE
Process Grade are the same for the design phase and the implementation
phase, including whether the team has at least one female member,
whether the team has 3-4 members or 5-7 members, and whether the team
has at least 20 commits on average.

**Table** **4 - Contingency table of Whether the team has at least one
female member and Process grade**

Table 3 showcases the distribution of process grade based on the number
of female team members. Specifically, 50% of the teams without a female
member received an A in teamwork process while 74% of those with at
least one female member received an A in SE process. In other words,
teams without female members seem to be more likely to be below the
expectation level in terms of SE Process grade. In terms of the number
of team members, teams with 3 to 4 students seem to be more likely to
receive and F in SE process grade than teams with 5 to 7 students.
Specifically, 62.5% of the teams with 3-4 were below expectation level,
lower than their 5-7-members counterparts whose proportion of receiving
an F is 25.9% (Table 4). Interestingly, the number of female members per
team and the number of members are significantly related to each other.
The two-sample proportion tests has indicated that teams with 3 to 4
members are significantly less likely to have at least one female member
than those with 5 to 7 members. That said, in the final model, only the
number of female members per team is used in order to avoid
multicollinearity.

Table 5 and 6 present the distribution of SE Process Grade based on the
average number of commit during the design phase and the implementation
phase, respectively. It can be seen that, for both the design phase and
the implementation phase, the proportion of receiving an F in process
grade for teams with at least 20 commits on average is lower than that
for teams with less than 20 commits on average.

### b. Modeling

The final logistic models that predict SE Process grade for the design
phase and the implementation phase both use two significant predictors:
number of female members and average number of commits. As mentioned
earlier, although the number of team members is also related to SE
process grade, it was removed from the final model due to
multicollinearity with the number of female members. Table 7 presents
the results of the final models that predict SE grade during the design
phase and the implementation phase.

**Table 7 - Results of the final models that predict SE process grade
during the design phase and the implementation phase**

Using the number of female members and the average number of commits to
predict SE Process Grade, none of the observations were removed. The
multiple linear regression models have resulted in a residual deviance
of 87.772 for the design phase and 86.883 for the implementation phase.
The p-values for the drop-in-deviance tests indicates that during both
the design and the implementation phase, the models using the number of
female members and average number of commits are effective. For the
design phase, 74.3% of the data were correctly predicted by the model.
For the implementation phase, the accuracy is rate is about 73%. In
assessing the conditions of a logistic regression model, the linearity
condition is satisfied since both predictors are binary.

According to table 7, both predictors are significant in the design
phase and the implementation phase. During the design phase, the
coefficient for whether a team has at least one female is -1.06. This
coefficient indicates that for teams that are either all have less than
20 commits or all have more than 20 commits, the odds of receiving an F
for those with at least one female member is 34.6% the odds of receiving
an F for teams without a female member. Similarly, for teams that either
all have no female members, or all have at least one female members, the
odds of receiving an F for teams with at least 20 commits on average is
33.7% that for teams with less than 20 commits on average.

2. Gender, Number of team members, and Number of commits and SE Product Grade
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### a. Exploratory data analysis

In investigating the factors related to SE product grade, four
explanatory variables demonstrate a potential relationship with SE
product grade: whether the team has at least one female member, whether
the team has 3-4 members or 5-7 members, the average number of commits,
and the percentage of unique messages for commits. It should be noted
that the average number of commits was treated as a numerical variable
in predicting SE product grade.

The relationship that gender has with SE product grade is opposite to
what we witnessed in SE process Grade. Table 8 showcases the
distribution of SE product grade based on whether the team has at least
one female member. Specifically, teams without female are more likely to
receive an A in SE product than teams with at least female, with
proportions of receiving an A are 75% and 48% respectively.

Table 9 - Contingency table of whether the team has 3-4 members or 5-7
members and Process grade

In terms of the number of team members, the relationship with SE product
grade is less clear than that with SE process grade. However, it seems
that teams with 5-7 members are less likely to be below expectation
level in terms of SE product, with a proportion of 0.413% compared to
that of 0.5% for teams with 3-4 members.

Figure 1 visualizes the distribution of SE product grade based on the
average number of commits and the percentage of unique message for
commits during the implementation phase. The figure has shown that the
teams that receive an F tend to have lower average number of commits and
lower percentage of ![](media/image1.png){width="3.808333333333333in"
height="2.158333333333333in"}unique messages during the implementation
phase. The relationship between these two variables with SE Product
Grade is not clear during the design phase.

### b. Modeling

number of commits, grouped by SE product grade

\\

The final models that predict SE product grade are exactly the same for
the two phases. Specifically, the models for the two phases both only
use whether the team has at least one female member as a predictor. The
other predictors discussed in the exploratory data analysis are dropped
due to either their insignificance in predicting SE product grade or
their failure to meet the linearity condition. As mentioned earlier,
whether the team has at least one female member is a constant variable
throughout the software engineering project (which included both the
design phase and the implementation phase). Therefore, there is one
common model that predicts SE product grade based on whether the team
has at least one female member, which is displayed in table 10.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

According to table 10, the drop-in-deviance of the model is 5.003 and
the relevant p-value is 0.03, indicating that the model is effective. In
assessing the assumption of a logistic regression model, linearity is
automatically satisfied because the predictor is a binary variable. The
accuracy rate of the model is about 59.5%, which is slightly better than
that of the null model (56.8%). The coefficient of 1.179 suggests that
the odds of receiving an F in SE product grade is 3.25 times higher for
teams with at least one female member than for all-male teams. This
relationship is opposite to the relationship between gender and SE
process grade where teams with at least one female member are less
likely to receive an F in process grade.

IV. Discussion
==============

The main findings of this research highlight the relationship between
gender and whether the team is at/above or below expectation in terms of
process grade and product grade. Specifically, results indicate that the
odds of receiving an F in process grade is lower for teams with at least
one female member than for teams without any. On the other hand, teams
with at least one female are more likely to receive an F in product
grade. This difference indicates that teams with at least one female
member tend to better demonstrate best software engineering practices
while the products of all-male teams tend to be rated higher.
Additionally, for process grade, this research finds that teams of 5-7
students are more likely to receive an A than teams with 3-4 students.
Last but not least, for process grade, an increase in the average number
of commits is associated with a decrease in the odds of receiving an F.

Except for the average number of commits per member, the other two
predictors -- whether the team has at least one female member and the
number of team members -- can be controlled by the instructor.
Therefore, when assigning students in software engineering classes, the
instructor can focus on these relationships in order to best promote
teamwork. The generalizability of the results, however, is questionable
due to the lack of random processes. A population that the results of
this paper can be safely applied to is one of students in high-level
software engineering classes in San Francisco State University. With
thorough research, one can even extend these findings to students in
software engineering classes among universities whose ranking of the
computer science/soft engineering department are of similar level to the
San Francisco State University.

The strength of this research is the simplicity of the final models
after multicollinearity among predictors were accounted for. One
shortcoming of this research is the recoding of numerical variables into
binary ones. For example, even though the results indicated that teams
with at least 20 commits on average are more likely to receive an A in
terms of process grade, this research is unable to identify the
difference (or similarity) in the odds of receiving an A between teams
with 20 commits on average and teams with 60 commits on average.
Moreover, due to the nature of an observational study, there are
confounding variables that are not addressed, such as whether the team
members had taken a similar software engineering class. If the team
members have done so, they tend to make more commits to the code
repository because experience from the other class has advised them to
keep track of the code frequently, while also preparing the team members
with the necessary practices that results in a higher chance to receive
an A in process grade. Another limitation is the biased way in which SE
process and SE product were graded. Even though the SE product and SE
process were graded by external reviewers, such assessments are still
based on subjective evaluation. Therefore, future research can look into
other ways that assess the effectiveness of software engineering
teamwork without bias.
